# From Diesel & DNA to Distributed Systems

I told myself I’d learn to fix three things: cars, people, and computers.

My path has been anything but linear. I’ve been a heavy-wheel diesel mechanic, an EMT, a bike messenger, and I've worked every position in a restaurant. I’ve performed mouse-brain surgery for electrophysiology research and spent over a decade in an organ transplant lab.

Today, I’m a Software Engineer (M.S. CS) building the systems that power the future of data and AI.

I don’t just write code; I am building tools that turn gigabytes of raw genomic and enterprise data into information that actually matters. I thrive in "ship-first" environments where data integrity is mission-critical and curiosity is a prerequisite.

Currently Obsessed With: Go (Golang), Distributed Systems (Raft), and LLM Orchestration.

The Philosophy: If it's broken, I can fix it. If it doesn't exist, I can architect it.
