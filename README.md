- 👋 Hi, I’m @joelcrouch
- 👀 I’m interested in computer science.  I am switching from a wet lab-DNA anaylysis and organ transplantation lab to working with data.
Ideally I will be able to use my lab knowledge and growing software development knowledge to get a great job writing some cool code and systems to help 
doctors use all the reams of data that is being made by new genomic sequencers to construct better medicine for people.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to be a software dev. at portland state university and by reading documentation.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that will help me learn python or java or c/c++.  I would love to read some code and figure out what it does
and write some good documentation.
- 📫 How to reach me:  please email me at joelcrouch@gmail.com.
