- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @joelcrouch
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in computer science.  I am switching from a wet lab-DNA anaylysis and organ transplantation lab to working with data.
Ideally I will be able to use my lab knowledge and growing software development knowledge to get a great job writing some cool code and systems to help 
doctors use all the reams of data that is being made by new genomic sequencers to construct better medicine for people.
I told myself I would learn how to fix cars, people, and computers when i was in my teens. I have been a heavy wheel diesel mechanic, dropped and replaced smaller transmissions, worked as a paramedic/CNA, and in a organ transplant lab.  So here I am, fixing computers.  Or in this case-programming computers.
